Excellent question — you're absolutely right to ask this. There’s a big difference between **community-maintained Helm charts** and how **real-world organizations** manage observability tooling like Prometheus, Grafana, EFK, Jaeger, etc.

## 🧰 1. Community Helm Charts vs. Enterprise Practice

| Aspect                       | Community Charts (like Helm Hub)                             | Enterprise/Org Practice                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**                | Maintained by OSS orgs (e.g., Bitnami, Prometheus Community) | Owned & curated internally                                     |
| **Customization**            | Limited to exposed `values.yaml`                             | Fully customizable (deep templating)                           |
| **Security**                 | Generic defaults (e.g., default passwords, no RBAC)          | Hardened (RBAC, auth, TLS, IAM integration)                    |
| **Version Control**          | Follows public repo releases                                 | Pinned/stable versioning in internal Git                       |
| **Release Strategy**         | Public updates may break things                              | Controlled deployment via GitOps/CD tools                      |
| **Infrastructure Alignment** | One-size-fits-all                                            | Tailored to cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and network policies |
| **Monitoring/Backup**        | Not included                                                 | Integrated with org-wide logging, backup, and DR plans         |

## 🏢 2. How Organizations Manage Helm Charts

### Option 1: Use Community Charts with Pinned Versions

* They use official charts from:

  * `prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack`
  * `grafana/grafana`
  * `bitnami/elasticsearch`
  * `fluent/fluent-bit`
  * `jaegertracing/jaeger`
* Then they **override values.yaml** in their Git repo.
* This is most common with **GitOps (ArgoCD / Flux)** or pipelines like Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

---

### Option 2: Fork and Maintain Internal Helm Charts

* They fork the community chart into a private Git repo.
* Then add:

  * Organization-specific RBAC
  * Monitoring annotations
  * IAM roles (IRSA for AWS)
  * Secrets via Vault/SSM
  * Custom alerts/dashboards
* All deployed via **CI/CD pipelines**.

---

### Option 3: Build Custom Helm Charts from Scratch

This is done when:

* The org needs **tight control** (security, compliance)
* The chart is simple enough (e.g., just Elasticsearch with custom config)
* They use **Terraform Helm provider** or **Helmfile** to manage releases

## 🔁 Example in Real-World Org

Let’s say your company runs EKS and uses ArgoCD. Here’s how they might deploy observability:

### 📦 Folder Structure

```
observability/
├── prometheus-stack/
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   ├── values.yaml      # org-wide config: IRSA, alerts, dashboards
│   └── templates/
├── efk/
│   ├── elasticsearch/
│   ├── fluent-bit/
│   └── kibana/
├── jaeger/
│   └── values.yaml      # custom exporter configs, persistence
```

All of this is managed via:

* GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux)
* Terraform `helm_release` blocks (in some orgs)
* Helmfile (for advanced dependencies)

## 🔍 Where to Get Official Helm Charts

| Tool                    | Official Helm Repo                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Prometheus Stack        | `prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack` |
| Grafana                 | `grafana/grafana`                            |
| Elasticsearch           | `bitnami/elasticsearch` or Elastic's own     |
| Fluent Bit              | `fluent/fluent-bit`                          |
| Jaeger                  | `jaegertracing/jaeger`                       |
| OpenTelemetry Collector | `open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector`     |
| Loki                    | `grafana/loki`                               |
| Tempo (Traces backend)  | `grafana/tempo`                              |

> 🛑 These are not always maintained by the same org that owns the software — so **read the chart maintainers carefully**.

## 🏁 TL;DR: What You Should Do on EKS

If you’re in a professional setting and want to follow best practices:

### ✅ Start with community Helm charts:

* Pin versions
* Use production-grade values.yaml (RBAC, IRSA, alerts)

### ✅ Store charts and values in Git (GitOps style)

* One Git repo: `observability-infra/`
* Split by component

### ✅ Use Helm via CI/CD (or ArgoCD)

Would you like a **production-ready Git repo structure** and values examples for these observability tools on EKS?
